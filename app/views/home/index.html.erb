  <p>Hi r/brisbane this is u/nodefense. I've put this barebones site together this evening just to show you that I'm serious about making the group idea I posted about a thing. Feel free to register (don't use your go-to password please, for your own safety), and I'll continue adding to the site tonight and tomorrow. You can expect a comments and events section to be up tonight I think, and I'll put lipstick on it tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Register <%= link_to "here", new_user_path %>, and then see people's projects <%= link_to "here", posts_path %>.</p>
  <p>Welcome to the thing, and here's to making it a valuable resource for web people in Brisbane!</p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Me.</p>
